During my role in frontend development, I successfully connected with the backend using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Leveraging technologies such as React and Tailwind CSS, I ensured seamless integration between the user interface and the backend functionalities. Additionally, I utilized Axios to facilitate smooth communication between the frontend and backend systems. My experience with Daysiui further enhanced the user interface design, resulting in an intuitive and visually appealing frontend. Working within the VS Code environment, I collaborated with the development team to deliver a cohesive and efficient frontend solution.
